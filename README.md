# Jobs
Compare many material's properties, then we choose a goal. that is **Band gap**!
so our job title is "**Band gap estimation**".

## [Band gap](https://github.com/2juhyeon/jobs/blob/main/etc/Band_gap.md)
  - The bandgap is the most important property in today's materials.
  - This property is coming from the quantum mechanical phenomena. so is hard work to estimate.
### how can estimate?
  - experimentally
  - Using DFT calculation
    - Hybrid functional, GW like calculation gives a good Band Gap but this cost(time, CPU usage, etc..) is very expensive.
  - Using machine learning?
    - If using machine learning is given good prediction, we can reduce costs.

## [Flow chart and Goals](https://github.com/2juhyeon/jobs/blob/main/etc/PPT.md)

    
## 1. [Papers](https://github.com/2juhyeon/jobs/blob/main/etc/papers.md)
  - Paper collection (relate to machine learning)

## 2. Methodology & theory
  - What property we prediction? (band gap)
  - What kind of method we uses? (studing in papers)
  - What property is given us good prediction? (studing in papers)

  - [PRML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)
  - [Reads1](http://events.kias.re.kr/h/physAI/)

## 3. [Environment](https://github.com/2juhyeon/jobs/blob/main/etc/environment.md)
  - env settings (linux, conda, etc..)
  
## 4. Data sets
  1. [materials projects](https://materialsproject.org/)
  2. [OQMD](https://oqmd.org/)
