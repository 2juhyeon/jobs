compare many material's properties, then we choose a goal. that is **band gap**!

## band gap
  - the bandgap is the most important thing in today's materials.
  - this property is coming from the quantum mechanical phenomena.
### how can estimate?
  - using DFT calculation
    - Hybrid functional, GW like calculation gives a good Band Gap but this cost(time, CPU usage, etc..) is very expensive.
  - using machine learning?
    - if using machine learning is given good prediction, we can reduce costs.
    
## 1. papers
  - paper collection (relate to machine learning)

## 2. methodology & theory
  - what property we prediction? (band gap)
  - what kind of method we uses? (studing in papers)
  - what property is given us good prediction? (studing in papers)
