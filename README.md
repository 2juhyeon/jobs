# Project
## Purpose
  (Band gap estimate)
  Compare many material's properties, then we choose a goal. that is **Band gap**!
  so our job title is "**Band gap estimation**".

### what is [Band gap](https://github.com/2juhyeon/jobs/blob/main/etc/Band_gap.md)
  - The bandgap is the most important property in today's materials.
  - This property is coming from the quantum mechanical phenomena. so is hard work to estimate.
### how can estimate?
  - experimentally
  - Using DFT calculation
    - Hybrid functional, GW like calculation gives a good Band Gap but this cost(time, CPU usage, etc..) is very expensive.
### Using machine learning?
  - If using machine learning is given good prediction, we can reduce costs.

## 1. Methodology & theory
  1. What property we prediction? (band gap)
  2. What kind of method we uses? (studing in papers)
  3. What property is given us good prediction? (studing in papers)

## 2. Current works
### 1. Data set acquirement 
  1. [materials projects](https://materialsproject.org/)
  2. [OQMD](https://oqmd.org/)
  3. [COD](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/)

### 2. [Pre-Processing](https://github.com/2juhyeon/jobs/tree/main/Pre-Processing) for feature Vector

### 3. [Codes (thanks to K.M. Kim)](https://github.com/2juhyeon/jobs/tree/main/Examples)
  - Collect useful examples and revise some part

## 3. Next Work
