Compare many material's properties, then we choose a goal. that is **band gap**!

## Band gap
  - The bandgap is the most important thing in today's materials.
  - This property is coming from the quantum mechanical phenomena.
### how can estimate?
  - Using DFT calculation
    - Hybrid functional, GW like calculation gives a good Band Gap but this cost(time, CPU usage, etc..) is very expensive.
  - Using machine learning?
    - If using machine learning is given good prediction, we can reduce costs.
    
## 1. Papers
  - Paper collection (relate to machine learning)
  - https://github.com/2juhyeon/jobs/blob/main/papers.md

## 2. Methodology & theory
  - What property we prediction? (band gap)
  - What kind of method we uses? (studing in papers)
  - What property is given us good prediction? (studing in papers)
