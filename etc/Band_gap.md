# Band gap

## what is **Band**?
  - In a solid, many-electron, the nucleus is exist inside materials. but their energy eigenvalue is couldn't same. this energy eigenvalue is make difference. then this shape is like a band.

## what is **Band gap**?
  - energy gap is seems like HOMO-LUMO gap. this comming from bonding state and anti-bonding state. this bonding and anti-bonding make energy difference in two states, HOMO(Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO(Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital).

## So we know Band and Band gap. So what?
