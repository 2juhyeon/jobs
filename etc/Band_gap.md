# Band gap

## what is **Band**?
  - in solid, many electron, nucleus is exsit of inside materials. but their energy eigen value is couldn't same. this energy eigenvalue is make difference then this shape like band.

## what is **Band gap**?
  - energy gap is seems like HOMO-LUMO gap. this comming from bonding state and anti-bonding state. this bonding and anti-bonding is
